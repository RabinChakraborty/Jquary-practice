Simon Game
This is a web-based implementation of the classic memory game "Simon". The game consists of four colored buttons (red, blue, green, and yellow) that light up in a random sequence. The player must repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the correct order. Each time the player successfully completes a sequence, the game adds one more step to the sequence. The game continues until the player makes a mistake, at which point the game ends.

This project was inspired by the original Simon game invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. Thanks to jQuery for making it easy to manipulate the DOM in JavaScript.
